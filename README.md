# Select Works for Oscilloscope

Submission for Crash The Planet

## Description

*Select Works for Oscilloscope* is a collection of animations by various artists and hackers that explore the relationship between art and technology.

This collection is created using Trammell Hudson's [v.st])(http://v.st/) platform for Vector Displays. Animations are composed in [Processing](processing.org) utilizing a custom library for generating vector line data in real-time. The data is streamed to a Teensy 3.2 and MPC4922 DACs, where the vector lines are converted to audio signals that are then displayed as 2D images on a vector display.

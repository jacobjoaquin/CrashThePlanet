# Select Works for Oscilloscope

Submission for Crash The Planet. March 17th, 2016

## Description

*Select Works for Oscilloscope* is a collection of animations by various artists and hackers that exploit retro vector display technology for artistic endeavors.

The compilation is created using Trammell Hudson's [v.st](http://v.st/) platform for Vector Displays. Animations are composed using a custom vector graphics [Processing](processing.org) library. Vector data is streamed to a Teensy 3.2 and set of MPC4922 DACs where the images are translated to audio signals and displayed on an oscilloscope.
